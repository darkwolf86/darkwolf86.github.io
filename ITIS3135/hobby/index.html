      <h2>What are video games?</h2>
      <p>Video games are a form of entertainment that can involve complex stories and a wide range of genres, much like movies or books. They offer players the chance to explore different worlds, characters, and experiences, often blending art, storytelling, and technology into one medium.</p>
      <p>Genres vary widely from first-person shooters (FPS), where the camera view is set behind the weapon you use in the game, to racing simulators so detailed that it can feel like you‚Äôre driving an actual race car. There are even military simulation games so realistic that some players have gone as far as leaking real military documents to prove their points.</p>
      <p>The way players control games also differs greatly. Some use controllers for gaming consoles, while others prefer a mouse and keyboard setup. Virtual reality has introduced motion reactive controls that track a player‚Äôs body movements and replicate them in-game. Recently, advancements in brain‚Äìcomputer interface technology have even allowed limited gameplay using neural signals. As technology continues to evolve, we may one day play video games using thought alone instead of traditional controllers.</p>

    <section id="who">
      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I was born near the coast in Whiteville, North Carolina, and raised on a family farm. My early years were spent doing the typical farm work. Growing crops, feeding chickens, and driving tractors. Despite that upbringing, I found myself drawn more toward technology than the outdoors. My first introduction came through a Nintendo console with just two games, Mario and Duck Hunt. Those simple experiences sparked a lasting interest in gaming and technology that would eventually shape my educational and professional path.</p>
      <p>As I grew older, that fascination evolved alongside the rapid development of the tech industry. I stayed current with new consoles and genres, renting games frequently to explore what was available. This steady exposure led me to pursue formal education in technology, beginning with an associate degree in technical support. Later, I decided to advance my education with a four-year degree in computer science. Unfortunately, due to credit transfer issues, I had to start over and rebuild my coursework from the ground up.</p>
      <p>Now, I am completing a degree that I had originally hoped to finish in 2018. After struggling with the math requirements in my previous program, my advisor recommended switching to a Bachelor of Arts to better align with my strengths and remaining credits. While I may not be working in game development as I once imagined, my education has given me the skills to stay connected to the technology and games I love. Titles like Borderlands 4 and Expedition 33 continue to remind me why I first fell in love with technology and how far that early curiosity has carried me.</p>

    <section id="when">
      <h2>When to Play</h2>
      <p>The best times to play video games vary depending on your schedule, lifestyle, and social circles. Work and class commitments often dictate gaming times.</p>
      <p>My friends and I normally game on fridays and saturdays together. I normally play solo player games during the week maybe an hour or 2 most nights. Recently had a friend drag me back into diablo 4. </p>
