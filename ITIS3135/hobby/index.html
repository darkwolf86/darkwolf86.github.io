      <h2>What are video games?</h2>
      <p>Video games are a form of entertainment that can involve complex stories and a wide range of genres, much like movies or books. They offer players the chance to explore different worlds, characters, and experiences, often blending art, storytelling, and technology into one medium.</p>
      <p>Genres vary widely from first-person shooters (FPS), where the camera view is set behind the weapon you use in the game, to racing simulators so detailed that it can feel like you‚Äôre driving an actual race car. There are even military simulation games so realistic that some players have gone as far as leaking real military documents to prove their points.</p>
      <p>The way players control games also differs greatly. Some use controllers for gaming consoles, while others prefer a mouse and keyboard setup. Virtual reality has introduced motion reactive controls that track a player‚Äôs body movements and replicate them in-game. Recently, advancements in brain‚Äìcomputer interface technology have even allowed limited gameplay using neural signals. As technology continues to evolve, we may one day play video games using thought alone instead of traditional controllers.</p>

    <section id="who">
      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I was born near the coast in Whiteville, North Carolina, and raised on a family farm. My early years were spent doing the typical farm work. Growing crops, feeding chickens, and driving tractors. Despite that upbringing, I found myself drawn more toward technology than the outdoors. My first introduction came through a Nintendo console with just two games, Mario and Duck Hunt. Those simple experiences sparked a lasting interest in gaming and technology that would eventually shape my educational and professional path.</p>
      <p>As I grew older, that fascination evolved alongside the rapid development of the tech industry. I stayed current with new consoles and genres, renting games frequently to explore what was available. This steady exposure led me to pursue formal education in technology, beginning with an associate degree in technical support. Later, I decided to advance my education with a four-year degree in computer science. Unfortunately, due to credit transfer issues, I had to start over and rebuild my coursework from the ground up.</p>
      <p>Now, I am completing a degree that I had originally hoped to finish in 2018. After struggling with the math requirements in my previous program, my advisor recommended switching to a Bachelor of Arts to better align with my strengths and remaining credits. While I may not be working in game development as I once imagined, my education has given me the skills to stay connected to the technology and games I love. Titles like Borderlands 4 and Expedition 33 continue to remind me why I first fell in love with technology and how far that early curiosity has carried me.</p>

    <section id="when">
      <h2>When to Play</h2>
      <p>When is a good time to game? That depends on your lifestyle, commitments, and social circle. There are many things to consider. As technology has advanced, the opportunities to fit gaming into your day have expanded.</p>
      <p>There are all kinds of ways to play now on PC, handheld systems like the Nintendo Switch, or mobile games on your phone. Each offers a different experience and requires a different time commitment. </p>
      <p>My friends and I usually play on weekends. I‚Äôll often spend an hour or two gaming most nights, but when the weekend comes and we find a game we really enjoy, we can go at it all day. One of my friends is a truck driver, so his time is limited, which makes those weekend sessions special. Occasionally, I‚Äôll play a mobile game during lunch, but most of my game time happens at night.</p>

    <section id="where">
      <h2>Where to Play</h2>
      <p>There are many places you can play games. As discussed in other sections, modern smartphones make it possible to play anywhere, anytime. There‚Äôs often a running joke about phone games being ‚Äútoilet games‚Äù something quick to play before you get up and move on. But that accessibility is part of what makes gaming so easy to start with today. You don‚Äôt need special equipment or a big setup; just a few minutes and a phone can get you into a game.</p>
      <p>Then there‚Äôs gaming at home or at a friend‚Äôs place. With modern internet connections, you don‚Äôt even need to be in the same room or the same country to play together. You can be on opposite sides of the world and still team up for a match or go on an adventure together, all while sitting comfortably on your own couch.</p>
     <p>Lastly, there are public places built for gaming experiences. Barcades, conventions, and even some amusement parks offer spots where you can play arcade cabinets or consoles set up for visitors. These spaces bring that social energy back into gaming laughter, competition, and shared excitement reminding us that no matter how advanced technology gets, the heart of gaming is still about connection and fun.</p>

    <section id="how">
      <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
      <p>Getting started with gaming has gotten easier over time. Most people carry a smartphone, and while many will say mobile gaming isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù gaming, it can be a great introduction to the hobby. It gives you a chance to get a feel for it and see if it‚Äôs something you enjoy before dropping hundreds of dollars on a console or PC to play modern games. Having friends who are also into gaming helps immensely you can hop into voice chat, talk about what you‚Äôre playing, or have them guide you if the game is multiplayer.</p>
      <p>It‚Äôs also good to experiment with different genres to find what clicks with you. There are countless types of games out there, from creative sandbox titles like Minecraft, where you build and make your own fun, to competitive shooters, strategy games, and vast role-playing adventures. Each genre offers something different, and exploring a few can help you figure out what kind of experiences you enjoy most.</p>
      <p>Personally, I‚Äôve never been drawn to the open-ended style of games like Minecraft. I need a mission a quest, a goal, a princess in a castle to save. I love games that pull me into their story, where I can focus on the dialogue and the world around me. Whether it‚Äôs fighting the forces of hell in DOOM or following the story-driven path of The Witcher, it all starts with that first time picking up a game and giving it a try.</p>

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why I Love Gaming</h2>
      <p>I play games for many reasons, but my favorites are the ones that focus on story. I‚Äôve always loved reading books or listening to audiobooks, so when a game adds interaction to a story, it draws me in completely. It‚Äôs like stepping into the pages of a book and taking part in the adventure myself.</p>
      <p>Gaming also gives me a way to unwind and distance myself from work and, now, school. It helps me shift my focus away from tickets about things not working or bills that need to be paid and onto something simpler, like the next boss fight or the next piece of gear. It‚Äôs an escape, a moment to breathe and reset.</p>
      <p>But more than anything, I game to be social and spend time with friends. Some are newer, others I‚Äôve been gaming with for over twenty years and writing that out just hit me hard, realizing how long it‚Äôs been. Those connections, old and new, are what make the experience special.</p>
